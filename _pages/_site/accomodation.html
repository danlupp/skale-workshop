<p>Oslo offers a wide range of hotels and accommodations. However, especially during the sun-filled months in summer, hotels are packed and it can be tricky to find a decently-priced stay within easy reach, especially if booking late. Below we provide a list of hotels which are reasonably close to either the conference venue or the city centre:</p>

<h5 id="budget-hotels">Budget Hotels</h5>

<p><a href="http://overnattingoslo.no/home">Overnatting Oslo</a>
(rooms with own (small) bathroom and kitchen in a quiet street in
  Grünerløkka, a popular central district in Oslo; from 45 Euro/night)</p>

<h5 id="hostels">Hostels</h5>
<p>There are a few high-standard youth hostels in Oslo and one can even find single rooms if booked in advance. Unfortunately, Oslo does not have too many of these youth hostels. One can try:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.haraldsheim.no">Haraldsheim Youth Hostel</a> which is nice and close to the Sinsen metro station.</p>

<p><a href="https://ankerhostel.no">Anker Hostel</a> which is nice and friendly, with more single rooms and more down-town, close to public transport.</p>

<p><a href="https://ronningen.fhs.no/om-skolen/vandrerhjemmet/">Hostel Ronningen YMCA</a> which is on the outskirts of Oslo, near the
forest. It is in walking distance to the train station and tram
station. It takes 30-45min to reach the conference site (using train first to Oslo S and then changing to the metro from there to the conference site). The same Oslo transportation ticket works up to there.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hihostels.no/hostels/oslo-holtekilen">Holtekilen Youth Hostel</a> which is also outside of Oslo centre but in
walking distance to the train station that takes about 10-15min to Oslo S.</p>
