<p>The DL workshop is the major annual event of the description logic research
community. It is the forum at which those interested in description logics,
both from academia and industry, meet to discuss ideas, share information and
compare experiences. The 32nd edition will be held in Oslo, Norway from
June 18th to June 21st, 2019.</p>

<h4 id="workshop-scope">Workshop Scope</h4>

<p>We invite contributions on all aspects of description logics, including but
not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Foundations of description logics</strong>: decidability and complexity of reasoning,
 expressive power, novel inference problems, inconsistency management,
 reasoning techniques, and modularity aspects</li>
  <li><strong>Extensions of description logics</strong>: closed-world and nonmonotonic reasoning,
 epistemic reasoning, temporal and spatial reasoning, procedural knowledge,
 query answering, reasoning over dynamic information</li>
  <li><strong>Integration of description logics with other formalisms</strong>: object-oriented
 representation languages, database query languages, constraint-based
 programming, logic programming, and rule-based systems</li>
  <li><strong>Applications and use areas of description logics</strong>: ontology engineering,
 ontology languages, databases, ontology-based data access, semi-structured
 data, graph structured data, linked data, document management, natural
 language, learning, planning, Semantic Web, cloud computing, conceptual
 modelling, web services, business processes</li>
  <li><strong>Systems and tools around description logics</strong>: reasoners, software tools for
 and using description logic reasoning (e.g. ontology editors, database
 schema design, query optimisation, and data integration tools),
 implementation and optimisation techniques, benchmarking, evaluation,
 modelling</li>
</ul>
