<p>The aim of the industry panel is to be a reality check for the DL
community on the use of ontologies and reasoning in industry: What are
the methods and technologies that are actually used, which are not,
and what is missing?  What works well, and what does not?</p>

<p>The panelists have extensive experience with and deep insights into the use
of semantic technologies, ontologies and reasoning applied to a
variety of domains. Each panelist will give a 10 minute presentation 
followed by an open discussion with questions from the audience.</p>

<p>The panel will be moderated by Martin G. Skjæveland, researcher,
University of Oslo.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Holding a PhD from from the University of Karlsruhe for research conducted in the area of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, he studied Artificial Intelligence, Psychology and Computer Science at the University of Amsterdam, NL. He conducted his Msc thesis on applications of Inductive Logic Programming at the University of Stockholm, Sweden. Dr. Engels (co-)authored several papers in the area, organised several international and local (german) workshops on practical applications of Data Mining. Being an independent consultant in the area, he is currently appointed organisations like Movation a.s, REPLY, NRK and the Western Norway Reserach Institute within the areas of semantic annotation strategies for multimedia, information access, AI/ML and computer linguistics.
Robert Engels has since 1986 worked on artificial intelligence, machine learning, knowledge management, logic and knowledge representation. His specialty is the field of semantic technologies. He has worked internationally with DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Telekom, NRK CognIT, and other research institutes and consultencies as a business developer, board member, researcher, product manager and software manager. Robert is currently the head of the department for artificial intelligence and machine learning at Capgemini Norge.</p>

<p><img src="images/hansen.jpg" width="150px" alt="Christian M. Hansen" /></p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Christian M. Hansen has a PhD from the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo in Logic &amp; Automated Reasoning, more specifically, on optimization techniques for first-order logic proof search algorithms. For the last 10 years, he has worked as a consultant in the oil &amp; gas industry, applying semantic technologies and building ontology-based systems which utilize DL reasoning. Christian has worked for 5+ years on Aibel’s Material Master Data (MMD) project, developing an engineering ontology to help manage complex requirements in new builds and modifications of oil &amp; gas platforms. The ontology is used in close cooperation with supporting software systems, including DL reasoning, as an important tool for improving the efficiency and quality of Aibel’s engineering projects. Aibel is currently developing a Digital Twin concept based on semantic technology, ontologies, and reasoning to improve lifecycle asset data management for oil &amp; gas installations. Christian recently joined Aibel as a full-time employee.</p>

<p><img src="images/kluwer.jpeg" width="150px" alt="Johan W. Klüwer" /></p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> With a background in applied logic, Johan specialises in
  development of enterprise ontologies, with emphasis on enabling
  automated reasoning for compliance with industry standards. In
  recent years he has made substantial contributions to Aibel’s MMD
  ontology and to Aker Solutions’ information model for the PUSH
  project, and advised Siemens Corporate Technology as well as various
  DNV GL departments. He has worked in Oil &amp; Gas, Health and life
  sciences, Maritime, Defence, and Public sector projects. In the
  Optique project, Johan contributed to dissemination activities and
  ontology development. His current focus is on methodology for
  digital requirements for the READI joint industry project, and asset
  models for integration of information across development and
  operations. He has contributed to modelling best practice and upper
  ontologies, mainly in making ISO 15926 work with OWL DL ontologies,
  and with ontology templates applying the OTTR framework to ontology
  engineering. He was part of initiating the Sirius Colloquium on
  industrial ontologies, and has lately engaged with the international
  Industrial Ontology Foundry, in an effort to disseminate the
  Norwegian community’s advances in ontology-based methods to a wider
  audience.</p>

<p><img src="images/wissmann.jpeg" width="150px" alt="Jens Wissmann" /></p>

<p><strong>Bio</strong> Jens Wissmann is a knowledge representation expert at the industrial automation company Festo. He is responsible for the architecture of the company’s semantic platform which captures product knowledge and allows to infer knowledge on product combinations. Prior to Festo he worked as big data engineer at United Internet where he was involved in developing large scale internet backends, notably the data backbone of the European netID Foundation. Previously, he was a researcher and project leader at FZI Research Center Karlsruhe in the field of ontology engineering and modelling. He received a PhD in Computer Science from City University London and earned his master’s degree in Cognitive Science from University of Osnabrück.</p>
