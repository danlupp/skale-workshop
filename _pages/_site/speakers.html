<p><strong>Title:</strong> A Theoretical View on Reverse Engineering Problems for
Database Query Languages</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A typical reverse engineering problem for a query language L is as follows: Given a database D and two sets P and N of tuples over D labeled as “positive” and “negative” examples, respectively, is there a query q in L that “explains” P and N, i.e., the evaluation of q on D contains all positive examples in P and none of the negative examples in N? Applications of reverse engineering problems include database explanations, data exploration, data security, relational classifier engineering, and the study of the expressiveness of query languages. 
In this talk I will present a family of tests that solve the reverse engineering problem described above for several query languages of interest, e.g., FO, CQ, UCQs, RPQs, CRPQs, etc. We will see that in many cases such tests directly provide optimal bounds for the problem, as well as for the size of the smallest query that explains the given labeled examples. I will also present restrictions that alleviate the complexity of the problem when it is too high. Finally, I will develop the relationship between reverse engineering and a separability problem recently introduced in the database theory literature 
to assist the task of relational classifier engineering with data management tools.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Inconsistency Handling in Ontology-Mediated Query Answering: A Progress Report</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> It is widely acknowledged that real-world data is
  plagued with numerous data quality issues, among them the presence
  of erroneous facts.  While already a serious issue for “plain”
  databases, the problem of handling imperfect data is even more
  critical in the setting of ontology-mediated query answering (OMQA),
  where even a single erroneous fact can provoke an inconsistency,
  thereby rendering classical OMQA semantics useless. This has
  motivated DL and KR researchers to study a variety of approaches for
  handling inconsistent data in OMQA, both building upon and extending
  techniques initially proposed for databases. Now that there has been
  about a decade of research on inconsistency handling in OMQA, the
  time is ripe to take a step back and evaluate the progress that has
  been made and what remains to be done. The first half of the talk
  will provide a brief overview of the state-of-the-art, presenting
  the main results and lessons learnt, with the remainder of the talk
  being devoted to discussing the limitations of current approaches
  and some ideas for moving forward.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Decidable Verification of Golog Programs: Situation Calculus Meets Description Logic</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the area of reasoning about action and change, one of the best understood formalisms is the situation calculus, which was originally proposed by John McCarthy in the late fifties. In its modern form, due to Ray Reiter, the situation calculus provides a solution to the frame problem and is also the basis for the action programming language Golog, which is used, among other things, to control the high-level behavior of robots. When considering the verification of temporal properties of Golog programs, one quickly runs into undecidability because of the expressiveness of the situation calculus. To tackle this problem we have teamed up with Franz Baader and his group, and we have been able to show that decidable verification can be obtained when the base logic is restricted to a Description Logic (DL). In this talk, I will begin by introducing a modal variant of the situation calculus and Golog. I will then define the verification problem and show how decidability can be achieved with the help of DL.</p>
