<p>Submissions may be of two types:</p>

<p>(1) We invite regular papers of up to 11 pages. If the authors prefer the paper to not appear in the proceedings, an additional 2-page abstract of the paper has to be submitted (the 2-page abstract would appear in the proceedings, in case of acceptance).</p>

<p>(2) Papers accepted or under review at some other conference can be submitted to the DL workshop as is. Such papers are not required to be reformatted. They should be submitted together with a 2-page abstract that also specifies where the paper has been accepted or is under review. Only the 2-page abstract would appear in the proceedings, in case of acceptance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>DL 2019 allows (but does not require) submissions to be anonymous, i.e. the PC members and the reviewers will not see the identity of authors in the submission system (EasyChair). If you wish to conceal your identity, please donâ€™t forget to omit it from the PDF file you are submitting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The regular papers and 2-page abstracts must be formatted using the Springer LNCS style. The list of references in these submissions does not count towards the page limit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The option to publish a 2-page abstract is designed for authors who wish to announce results that have
 been published elsewhere, or which the authors intend to submit or have
 already submitted to a venue with an incompatible prior / concurrent
 publication policy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All submissions may optionally include a clearly marked appendix (e.g.,
 with additional proofs or evaluation data). The appendix will be read at
 the discretion of the reviewers and not included in the proceedings. The
 appendix does not need to be in LNCS format.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accepted regular papers and 2-page abstracts will be made available electronically
 in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings series (<a href="http://www.CEUR-ws.org/">http://www.CEUR-ws.org/</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accepted submissions, be they regular papers or 2-page abstracts, will be
 selected for either oral or poster presentation at the workshop. Submissions
 will be judged solely based upon their content, and the type of submission
 will have no bearing on the decision between oral and poster presentation.</p>
