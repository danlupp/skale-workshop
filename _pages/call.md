The workshop invites contributions of three kinds: research papers, in use papers, and challenge papers. Common for all contributions is that they must be relevant for the development and/or maintenance of large scale knowledge bases. All papers must emphasize their contributions’ applicability at scale. This can be realized via a formal evaluation, demonstration, or other reasonable argumentation.

 All papers must be in PDF and formatted in the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Accepted papers will be published with CEUR. 

#### Research papers 
Research papers present novel theoretical, analytical and empirical contributions in topics such as, but not limited to:
- knowledge base abstraction mechanisms, e.g., patterns and templates, and their applications
- constructing and updating knowledge bases from unstructured and structured data sources; ontology bootstrapping 
- management of multiple ontologies: alignment, reusability and interoperability; change management; quality checks; ontology architecture
- presentation and visualization techniques for large-scale knowledge bases
development environments: collaborative tools; tools and methods
adapted to different user roles (e.g., ontology experts, domain
experts, programmers, end-users).

Research papers must be between 10 and 15 pages excluding references.

#### In-use papers
In-use papers are reports from real-world developments and/or deployments of large knowledge bases that give new insights to the field. We are particularly interested in demonstrations of:
- representation and application of regulations and industry standards
- integration and automation of knowledge intensive work processes
- liberating data from enterprise applications
The report must explain the novelty of the reported use case, and should emphasize the “how” and “why”, such as:
- motivate and explain the choice of tools and methods used
- motivate and explain the architectural and design choices made to ensure scalability
- lessons learnt, positive and negative, compromises and limitations
- the costs and benefits of the use of semantic technologies over other technologies
We encourage reports that make use of open source tools and resources,
and where the lessons learnt are also presented as challenges in order
to foster new research and developments by the community.

In-use papers must be between 10 and 15 pages excluding references.

#### Challenge papers
Challenge papers present open problems motivated by real-world needs which clearly fall within the scope of the workshop. The problem should be clearly motivated and described by explaining why the problem is relevant for the workshop and the potential value of solving the problem. The paper should reflect over related work and possible solutions and non-solutions.

Authors of a selection of accepted challenge papers and in use papers that contain challenges will be invited to the industry panel (see description below).

Challenge papers must be no longer than 4 pages excluding references.
