While the use of semantic knowledge bases is steadily gaining industrial interest, as evidenced by the various solutions presented in in-use and industry papers at ISWC and similar conferences, ontologies are by and large still a fringe technology in most industries. A major impediment for industrial uptake is often attributed to the lack of scalability; the development, maintenance and use of semantic knowledge bases and the tools and methods that are built to support these tasks usually require considerable specialist training and are therefore essentially completely unknown and/or foreign to the average data/information worker. Enterprises that wishes to explore the benefits (and costs) of using semantic technologies will likely lack the necessary competence and will find that there are a few off-the-shelf ontologies, tools and methodologies that fit their existing system architecture and information flow. Additionally, there are few leading examples and success stories to go by.

The workshop wishes to attract and stimulate novel research and innovative advances of semantic technologies with the aim of making these technologies relevant and useful for any modern data driven industry. The workshop also wants to investigate where the real world problems are; where and what are the real show stoppers for efficient large-scale deployments of ontology-based information systems?
